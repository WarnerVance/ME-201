\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project was to make a crane capable of lifting a heavy object as fast as possible using as little mass as possible. 
We were given a chassis, motors, pulleys,  and a microcontroller; everything else we had to make ourselves. 
This includes several aluminum scaffolding components, a base made of HDPE, structural braces, and a wooden support implement. 

\section{Design: Warner}

\subsection{Pulley System}
We decided early on to make a simple crane, so that we could focus our efforts on optimization.
We wanted to lift 2.1 kg, and we designed the crane around it. 
We did some quick math and determined that a block and tackle system that split the tension in half would be best. 
Using a spreadsheet, we came up with an equation (Equation \ref{eq:Torque-Speed}) for the relationship between torque and rotational speed of a motor. 
This equation was then multiplied by two to account for the fact that two motors were being used. 
This equation was then put into EES along with an equation that related the torque to the radius of the pulley and the weight of the object being pulled up.
\begin{equation}
    \text{torque}=-0.1294 * \text{rotational speed}+0.2649 \label{eq:Torque-Speed} 
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =.45\linewidth]{Torque_Speed.png}
    \caption{A graph of the relationship between the radius of the drive pulley and the vertical velocity of the object being lifted. Torque delivered from the motors is also included for reference.}
    \label{fig:Torque_Speed}
\end{figure}

We derived the vertical velocity of the object using equation \ref{eq:Velocity}.
\begin{equation}
        \text{Velocity}=\frac{2*\pi*{\text{Radius}*\text{Rotational Speed}}}{\text{Number of Lines connected to bucket}} \label{eq:Velocity}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
       & \text{Velocity} \text{ is the vertical velocity of the object being lifted} \\
        &\text{Radius}  \text{ is the radius of the drive pulley} \\
        &\text{Rotational Speed}  \text{ is the rotational speed of the drive pulley} \\
        &\text{Number of Lines connected to bucket}  \text{ is the number of lines connected to the bucket}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The subsequent parametric study and graph showed that 1 inch was the ideal drive pulley radius because it maximized the vertical velocity of the object being lifted.  This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Torque_Speed}.

\subsection{Counterweight}
We then moved on to calculating both the mass and the position of the counterweight. 
First, we repeated an earlier lab procedure to find the center of mass of the crane using Equations \ref{eq: CM1} to \ref{eq: CM2}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.6\linewidth]{null (3).png}
    \caption{A diagram of the crane}
    \label{fig:Crane}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}
        w_{\text{tip}}= & m_{\text{tip}} * 9.8 \label{eq: CM1} \\ 
        t_{\text{tip}}= & w_{\text{tip}}*x_{\text{out}}\label{eq:Torque 1} \\ 
        t_{\text{tip}}= & w_{\text{crane}}*x_{\text{cm}}\label{eq:Torque 2} \\
        x_{\text{cm}}= & \frac{t_{\text{tip}}}{w_{\text{crane}}} \label{eq: CM2}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \text{Where:} \\
        m_{\text{tip}} & \text{ is the mass of the object that makes the crane tip} \\
        w_{\text{tip}} & \text{ is the weight of } m_{\text{tip}} \\
        x_{\text{out}} & \text{ distance from the lifting side wheel to where the mass is hung} \\
        t_{\text{tip}} & \text{ is the torque from the object that makes the crane tip} \\
        w_{\text{crane}} & \text{ is the weight of the crane without the counterweight} \\
        x_{\text{cm}} & \text{ is the x from the lifting side wheel to the center of mass of the crane.} \\
        \text{Note:} & \text{ Check figure \ref{fig:Crane} for a diagram of the crane.}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}



Equation \ref{eq:Torque 1} and \ref{eq:Torque 2} are made possible by the fact that at the moment of tipping, the sum of the moments must be zero because nothing should be moving. 

Once the center of mass was found, we could then calculate the mass of the counterweight. A free body diagram of the pulleys can be found in figure \ref{fig:Pulleys}. This helps 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.6\linewidth]{null (2).png}
    \caption{A free body diagram of the pulleys}
    \label{fig:Pulleys}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}
& w_{\text{lift}}=m_{\text{lift}}*9.81 \\
& t_{\text{lift}}= \frac{w_\text{lift}}{2}*x_{\text{out}}+ w_{\text{lift}}*(x_\text{out}-x_{\text{pulleys}}) \footnotemark \label{eq:CW 1} \\ 
% (x_cm * w_crane) + (((x_wheels/2) + x_cw) * w_cw) = t_lift
& t_{\text{lift}} = x_{\text{cm}} * w_{\text{crane}} + x_{\text{cw}} * w_{\text{cw}} \label{eq: CW 2} \\
& m_{\text{cw}} = \frac{w_{\text{cw}}}{9.81}
\end{align}
\footnotetext{Equation \ref{eq:CW 1} was created when we only had one pulley attached to the boom. Luckily the calculated counterweight still worked when we added the second pulley.}
Where:
\begin{equation}
 \begin{split}
    & x_{\text{pulleys}}  \text{ is the distance betweens the pulleys and the anchor of the string on the boom } \\
    & x_{\text{cw}}  \text{ is the distance of the counterweight from the crane side wheel} \\
    & t_{\text{lift}} \text{ is the torque from the object being lifted} \\
    & m_{\text{lift}} \text{ is the mass of the object being lifted} \\
    & w_{\text{lift}} \text{ is the weight of the object being lifted} \\
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
Equations \ref{eq:CW 1} and \ref{eq: CW 2} are made possible by the fact that at the moment of lifting, the sum of the moments must be zero because nothing should be moving.

This equation allowed us to perform a parametric study to find the ideal position and mass of the counterweight. The resulting graph can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Counter Weight.png}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =.55\linewidth]{Counter Weight.png}
    \caption{A graph of the relationship between the mass of the counterweight and the vertical velocity of the object being lifted.}
    \label{fig:Counter Weight.png}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Counter Weight.png} came in quite handy as we had to adjust the counterweight several times during the project.
Eventually we ended up making our counterweight boom 13 inches long\footnote{This distance refers to the distance from the center mast of to the end of the counterweight. This translates to a $x_{\text{cw}}$ of around 9.969 inches} which translated to a $m_{\text{cw}}$ of 0.7 kg.

\section{Construction: Sam }
At the beginning of our endeavor, we decided to make a simple crane that would lift a 2.1kg mass using a 1-inch radius pulley that we would 3D print with PLA from the Makerspace.  
Firstly, we needed a base, boom, and mast for our crane.  
We made a base out of HDPE from the teamlab to lift up the overall structure of the crane so that none of the screws in the chassis would get in the way of any construction.  
We precisely cut parts of square aluminum for the mast, boom, counterweight boom, and boom braces in the team lab and drilled a considerable number of holes in them. 
Then, we used a lot of Alloy Steel Socket Head Screws and their corresponding nuts to secure the crane structure.  
In our original design, we fabricated a 1 inch radius 3D printed PLA pulley in the makerspace with hubs on both sides of the pulley so that we could drill a hole through each hub and place set screws to attach the pulley to the motor.  
Each motor would rest on an L bracket. A render of this design can be found in Figure \ref{fig:Crane_Render_1}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{Crane_render_1.png}
    \label{fig:Crane_Render_1}
    \caption{A 3D model of the original crane design.}
\end{figure}

However, this design ultimately failed.  The PLA of the pulley was too weak for the set screws to be in place, and the L brackets were not strong enough to keep the blue motors sturdy while functioning.  Therefore, we had to create a new design.  We decided to create a vertical wood support from the team lab and screwed it in the side of the base.  After that, we vertically positioned each motor and screwed them in the wood support.   Then, we 3D printed two small gears for each motor and one big gear out of PLA Carbon Fiber in the makerspace to make sure the power from the motors doesnâ€™t destroy them.  We drilled holes through the center of each small gear and screwed them into the motor.  We then carefully cut a slim piece of HDPE using the saw in the lab and drilled two holes in it.  One hole was for securing it to the wooden support, the other acted as an axle for the big gear so it could spin.  Then, we drilled a hole in the center of the big gear slightly larger than the hole in the slim HDPE piece so that it can spin freely with minimal friction from the screw.  Then, we drilled two holes through both the big gear and our .75 inch radius pulley and put two .5 inch screws through them and tightened by screwing a nut on the back of each screw.  Finally, we screwed the big gear to the slim HDPE piece with nuts in front and behind it to keep it from falling out of the small gears below it.   Afterwards, we focused on our counterweight.  We decided that our yellow motor was going to pull in our measured .7kg counterweight in towards the base through a string and then back out when needed.  So, we decided to zip tie the yellow motor to our boom brace and screw in another .75in pulley.  We then put our counterweight in a ziplock bag, tied it with a rope, connected it to the end of the counterweight boom,  and connected the counterweight and the pulley with string.  Lastly, we put extensions to both our pulleys to keep the strings from falling out and getting in between the gears. An image of this design can be found in Figure \ref{fig: Crane_render_2}

\section{Testing: Malini}

\end{figure}

Before designing and building our crane, we tested many mechanisms of the crane through our labs in the ME 201 course. 
During the assessment, one of the key findings was the strength of the string, which is a crucial factor in determining the maximum weight our crane can lift. 
If the string breaks, it renders the crane ineffective.
Luckily, the assessment proved the stringâ€™s ability to support over 3 kilograms.
Once these preliminary tests were completed and project groups were assigned, tests went hand-in-hand with construction; we tested any new components as they were added, identifying any issues with said parts we designed and fabricated or simply obtained from the given resources in the lab. 
The first of such tests included merely our basic design for the lifting mechanism. 
This design included a crane mast and boom with our chosen pulley system attached (see Figure \ref{fig:pic of Crane}), and lacked any attachment to our three given motors. 
Manually, a team member raised the bucket through the pulley system to evaluate its stability and ensure fluidity of the movement and therefore a dependable base design to thenforth optimize. 

Next, my team initiated a test to determine if the first pulley we 3D printed from polylactic acid (PLA) in the Makerspace with the optimized radius of 1 inch (see Figure \ref{fig:Torque_Speed}) for our system would have any issues in lifting the bucket. 
Having decided on a goal of at least 2.01 kilograms to be lifted by the crane, we tested the ability of the printed pulley to support this specific weight. 

When the pulley started to buckle, we reevaluated our use of PLA and that of a 3D printed part due to the hollow nature of the printing technique. 
Ultimately, our team decided to reprint the part with more additional infill and layers of PLA for the walls. 
After bolstering the part yielded our replacement pulley, we swapped it for the previous pulley to stage a test otherwise identical to that prior. 
Although our ultimate design didnâ€™t include this specific pulley due to issues attaching the material to the motor, our findings in these two tests greatly benefited our following design adaptations due to our greater understanding of the materials available in the Makerspace.


\section{Future Work}
The aspect of the crane designing/building process that we would likely do differently and our advice to future students have lots of overlap in that the advice of starting early should not be disregarded. 
While we started working right away, we were still overwhelmed by a great number of unknown variables in the equations and procedures that we needed to create and carry out. 
If we were to go back and reprise our approach to the project, our new attempt would involve us taking minimal time to assign values to variables that would be found subsequently (e.g, mass of crane, length of counterweight deployment mechanism).

Pivoting to the question of what future projects we would like to see, there are many possibilities, as one of the leading attractions of the project was the great amount of creative freedom we had in designing our cranes. 
While also undoubtedly being the hardest part of the project, that liberty forced us to think through our choices more thoroughly than mere equations could. 
One idea that our team mentioned was a design inspired by crane arcade games to add another layer of excitement to the competition, and would require students to have some understanding of programmingâ€”which would be taught in the courseâ€”to control an opening and closing mechanism of the crane hand. 
Another idea was the use of centripetal force and a spinning crane to hit a target with some kind of attachment to the end of the string it lifts. 
This would also involve programming, as the crane must spin at a certain speed to stay on theme with work in the system, and calculations with respect to the position to which the crane must raise the string. 
Overall, we would love to see the creative nature of the project kept intact to continue to foster the growth in creativity, engineering application, and teamwork that our team experienced.
